three-meteor
========
A very basic meteor package for [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js "three.js"). **Currently only the core functionality is packaged.**

To install, run `mrt add three.js` followed by `mrt install` within a meteor project. Simply call the `THREE` object in your application to get started.
